# C-course
C/C++ was studied at a high level and the Treasure Island graduation project was implemented.

## Description
In this course were made different C/C++ tasks with I/O, stdin/stdout streams, network (client-server) communication.
I created a network calculator and a network [graduation project](https://github.com/v-mk-s/Treasure-Island-Game).
